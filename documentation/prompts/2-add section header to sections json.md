s3xtans: add section header to sections.json

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add a section header to the sections.json file. Let me first understand the structure of the file and see what kind of section header you might need.

Looking at your sections.json file, it already contains various sections for your Verdant website, such as hero, about, care guides, etc. A section header would be a new property in each section object that defines a heading or title that appears above the main content.

Let me add a "sectionHeader" property to each section in the file:

I've successfully added a `sectionHeader` property to all sections in the sections.json file. Here's what I've added for each section:

1. Hero Section: "Welcome"
2. About Section: "Our Story"
3. Care Guides Section: "Plant Care"
4. Expert Tips Section: "Pro Tips"
5. Newsletter Section: "Stay Updated"
6. Testimonials Section: "Success Stories"

These section headers could be used in your website to display a concise heading above each major section, which helps with both navigation and visual hierarchy. You can now reference these headers in your HTML or JavaScript code to display them on your website.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do with these section headers now that they've been added?
