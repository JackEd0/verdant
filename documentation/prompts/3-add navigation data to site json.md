Now I'll check the current structure of the site.json file to understand where to add the navigation data:

I've successfully added the navigation data to your site.json file! The navigation information from your index.html has now been structured as a proper JSON object at the top level of your site configuration.

Here's what I added:

- A new `navigation` object at the root level of your JSON structure
- The brand name "Verdant" from the HTML
- An array of navigation items, each containing:
  - The ID of the navigation element
  - The display text for each menu item
  - The href attribute (link destination) for each menu item

The navigation structure now matches exactly what was in your HTML file, including:
- About
- Care Guides
- Expert Tips
- Contact

This structured data will make it easier to manage your navigation from the admin interface and keep it consistent with your site's content.
