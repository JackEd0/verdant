s3xtans: update site.json to be able to edit important elements in index.html. for example, we need to be able to target the heading of the hero section using hints in site.json

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you update the site.json file to include proper editing hints that can be used to target important elements in the index.html file. Let me analyze the current structure of your JSON file and make the necessary changes.

First, let me look at the current structure of site.json to better understand how to implement these editing hints.

Based on your site.json file, I can see that it already has a well-structured organization with sections like "hero", "about", "care-guides", etc. Each section has content attributes like "heading", "subheading", etc.

To make these elements targetable from the admin panel, I'll add specific selector attributes to each important element. This will help JavaScript code in the admin panel to locate and modify these elements in the index.html.

Let me update the site.json file:

Now let's update the sections to include selector hints for each editable element:

I've successfully updated the site.json file to include selector attributes that can be used to target important elements in the index.html file. Here's what I've added:

1. **For Navigation Elements:**
   - Added a `selector` attribute to the navigation brand and each navigation item

2. **For Each Section:**
   - Added a main `selector` attribute for the section container
   - For important content elements within each section:
     - Added `headingSelector`, `subheadingSelector`, etc. for text elements
     - Added `buttonSelector` for call-to-action buttons
     - Added `imageSelector` for images
     - Added array item selectors (e.g., `#guide-watering`, `#tip-1`) for list items
     - Added container selectors (e.g., `#guides-container`, `#tips-container`) for list containers

3. **Structure Pattern:**
   - Each editable element now follows the pattern: `{content property}` + `{content property}Selector`
   - For example: `heading` + `headingSelector`

These changes will allow your admin panel to easily target specific HTML elements for editing based on the selectors defined in the site.json file. Your JavaScript code can now use these selectors to find and modify content in the index.html.

For example, to target the hero section heading, you can now use the selector `#hero-heading` specified in the JSON file.
